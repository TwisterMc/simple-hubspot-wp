# Simple HubSpot Forms Integration WordPress Plugin

A lightweight WordPress plugin that allows you to easily embed HubSpot forms into your WordPress pages and posts using shortcodes.

This plugin can replace the [official HubSpot plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/leadin/) if you want something more lightweight. It'll work with the same shortcodes, just deactivate the official plugin and activate this one. There are no HubSpot integrations other than embedding a form.

## Installation

1. Download the plugin files
2. Upload the `hubspot-forms` folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

## Usage

Use the shortcode `[hubspot]` in your posts or pages to embed a HubSpot form. The shortcode accepts two parameters:

- `id` (required): The HubSpot Form ID
- `portal` (required): Your HubSpot Portal ID

### Example

```
[hubspot portal="12345678" id="nrd5c5e0-6f2f-46b1-95d7-aacb3975e9df"]
```

### Finding Your Form and Portal IDs

1. In HubSpot, navigate to Marketing â†’ Forms
2. Find your form, but don't click on it
3. Click the "Actions" button
4. In the embed code, you'll find both your Portal ID and Form ID
